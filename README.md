# php-webshell
<p>a basic and simple php webshell</p>
<p>For command execution it uses exec_shell(). Some systems do prevent this function from execution, so you might wanna try with the function system() which is more likely to be available on the systm.</p>
<p>Feel free to to modify the code to your needs (e.g. using system() instead for code execution or modifying the looks to your liking).</p>
<p><b>Do not use this webshell for illegal purpose! Use it to learn, play around with it, enhance etc.</b></p>
